                            "I found it frustrating that in those days, there was different information on different computers, but you had to log on to different computers to get at it ... So, finding out how things worked was really difficult," - Berners-Lee, Tim (USA TODAY, 2019)

                                        <li>Scheme or Protocol
                                          <p>The scheme or protocol specifies the procedure to follow in order to access the resource. Plans typically consist of:</p>

                                          <p>The domain name, sometimes referred to as the hostname, of the resource identifies the server or computer where it is stored. A domain name that may be read by others, such as "www.example.com," or an IP address, such as "192.168.1.1," are both acceptable. Although "www" frequently precedes the domain name, it is not needed.</p>

                                          <p>After the domain name, you can add a port number, separated by a colon (for instance: 8080). Different services on the same server can be distinguished by their ports. Without a port number, the scheme's default (for instance, 80 for HTTP and 443 for HTTPS) is utilized.</p>
                                        </li>

                                          <p>The path identifies the precise location of the resource on the server. Its hierarchical structure typically mirrors how server-side folders and files are arranged. For instance, the path in the URL https://www.example.com/products/laptops contains the words "products" and "laptops".</p>
                                        </li>

                                          <p>A subdomain is a smaller domain name that is part of a larger domain name inside the DNS order. It is used to group and categorize various website services or elements under a single domain. Following the main domain are various subdomains, which are separated by periods (dots).</p>
