            The Internet has been around for decades. The Internet is a very
            large network that links computers from everywhere in the world -
            which allows the users of the Internet to access and share
            information as well as allowing users from all places to communicate
            with one another.
          </p>
          <p class="content">
            The Internet like all things started as mere concept. The concept
            was written by a man known as J.C.R. Licklider in August of 1962.
            The concept was called the “Galactic Network”. In 1965 two computers
            in the United States of America were connected and built the first
            ever wide-area computer network. Although some services were
            available between the computers, overall, it was inadequate for the
            job.
          </p>
          <p class="content">
            Throughout the 70's and 80's the concept became a reality. During
            this time period - the Internet was being refined, improved, and
            finalised by people from Institutions all across the globe. Many
            people and Institutions got involved and would be vital in the
            process of implementing the Internet that would become a turning
            point in global civilisation. The Internet was officially launched
            on the 30 <sup>th</sup> of April 1993 - “four years after publishing
            a proposal for “an idea of linked information systems,” computer
            scientist Tim Berners-Lee released the source code for the world's
            first web browser and editor.” (History.com Editors, 2020).

              The Internet provides a wide variety of services. These services
              include:
            </dt>
            <dd class="listItems">- Communication Services</dd>
            <dd class="listItems">- Information Retrieval Services</dd>
            <dd class="listItems">- File Transfer</dd>
            <dd class="listItems">- World Wide Web Services</dd>
            <dd class="listItems">- Web Services</dd>
            </dl>
          </p>
          <p class="content">
            The Internet allows for a wide range of services to be provided regarding communication, information retrieval and transferring. “We have the ability to access or obtain information as needed. To access/exchange a large amount of data such as software, audio clips, video clips, text files, other documents, etc., we require internet services.” (Shakhandelwal, 2021). Thus, it is evident that the internet plays a vital role through the offering of services - that are required for things in our everyday lives.

            "The internet can be defined as a global computer network providing
            a variety of information and communication facilities, consisting of
            interconnected networks using standardized communication protocols.”
